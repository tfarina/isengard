# examples/

**Primary intent:** Illustration
**Typical question:** “How does this work?”

This directory contains small, focused example programs that demonstrate
specific C language features, macros, or usage patterns.

Examples are:
  - Intentionally minimal
  - Written to be read and understood
  - Focused on illustrating one idea clearly
  - Clean and explanatory, even if not broadly reusable

If an example grows into exploratory work, it may belong in
`experiments/`. If it grows into reusable functionality, it belongs in
`common/`.
