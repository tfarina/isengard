# Lexer Example

This directory contains a small, self-contained lexer example written in C.

The code demonstrates the basic building blocks of lexing, including token
definitions, character-based tokenization, and driving the lexer from file
input. It is intentionally minimal and limited in scope.

The primary goal of this example is educational. It is meant to be **read
and run** to understand how a simple lexer can be structured in C, rather
than treated as a complete or evolving compiler implementation.

Typical questions answered by this example include:
- How can input be scanned and classified into tokens?
- How are token kinds represented and used?
- How can a simple lexer be organized across multiple source files?

This example is not a full compiler, nor is it intended to become one.
Its purpose is illustration and learning.
