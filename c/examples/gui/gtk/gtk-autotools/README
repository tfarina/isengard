# gtk-autotools

This directory contains a small GTK application built using the
GNU Build System (Autotools).

The goal of this example is educational. It is intended to be read,
built, and experimented with in order to understand:

- How a basic GTK application is structured
- How GLib and GTK are integrated in an Autotools-based build
- How common GTK-related tooling (such as `glib-compile-resources`)
  fits into the build process

This is **not** meant to be a full application or framework. It is a
minimal, focused reference project that demonstrates how the pieces
work together in practice.

## Building from source

To build and install from source, run:

```sh
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

You can customize the build by passing options to `configure`.
For example:

```sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
```

Run `./configure --help` to see all available options.
