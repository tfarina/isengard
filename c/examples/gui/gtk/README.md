# GTK Examples

This directory contains small, focused GTK programs intended to demonstrate
specific widgets, concepts, or API usage.

Each subdirectory is a self-contained example that can be built and run
independently. The examples are deliberately minimal and are meant to be
**read and executed** as learning references rather than treated as full
applications.

Typical questions answered by these examples include:
- How do I create a basic GTK window?
- How do I use a specific widget (e.g. TreeView, MenuBar, Toolbar)?
- How do common GTK dialogs and UI patterns work?

These programs are not production-ready applications and are not intended
to form a reusable library. Their primary purpose is illustration and
experimentation with GTK APIs in C.
