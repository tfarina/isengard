hello is a minimal example program written in C that simply prints a
localized “Hello, world!” message.
Its main purpose is to demonstrate clean and modern practices for
setting up a small C project using the GNU Autotools build system,
including integration with GNU gettext for internationalization
and localization support.

This project is intentionally simple — it serves as a reference
template for developers who want to learn or bootstrap their own
Autotools-based software with proper build configuration, translation
infrastructure, and standard project layout.
