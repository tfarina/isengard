Hash table data structure in C by Christopher Clark was originally at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cwc22/hashtable

The following sources files were locally copied from a git mirror by David A Roberts available at:
  http://github.com/davidar/c-hashtable

  - hashtable.h
  - hashtable.c
  - hashtable_private.h


The following modification was needed to fix a bug:
  - hashtable.c  =>  don't free the key that was not malloced in the library during entry setup

Actually this was copied from git repository available at:
https://github.com/rcarbone/rperf/tree/7aa37cf1f2536d41aba54480ed16c73b55c3eec8/src/hashtables/implementations/clark/3rdparty
