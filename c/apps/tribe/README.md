# Tribe

This project was originally developed inside the `isengard` repository
under `sqlite`, then moved to `c/apps/sab`, later renamed to `tribe`.

At commit c83bb8b ("tribe: replace xstring.[ch] with xalloc.[ch]"), the
project was extracted into its own dedicated Git repository, preserving
full history.

The active development of Tribe now lives here:
