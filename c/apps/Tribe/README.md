# Tribe

This project was originally developed inside the `isengard` repository
under `c/apps/WunderPeople`, later renamed to `Tribe` by commit 2aef823
("rename 'WunderPeople' project to 'Tribe'").

At commit a7fffcf ("Tribe: add a license"), the project was extracted
into its own dedicated Git repository, preserving full history.

The active development of Tribe now lives here:
