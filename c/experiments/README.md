# experiments/

**Primary intent:** Exploration
**Typical question:** “What happens if I try this?”

This directory contains exploratory and learning-focused C programs.

Code here is written to investigate language features, APIs, patterns,
or behaviors, and may include incomplete, experimental, or intentionally
naive implementations.

Experiments are typically:
  - Self-contained
  - Focused on discovery rather than polish
  - Allowed to be messy or temporary
  - Written while learning, not after understanding

If a piece of code here becomes stable, reusable, or instructional,
it should be moved to `common/` or rewritten as an `example/`.

Do not remove this directory lightly — it serves as a historical and
educational record of explored ideas.
