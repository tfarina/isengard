Install Pip
===========

$ git clone https://github.com/pypa/pip.git
$ cd pip
$ sudo python setup.py install

Install WebPy
=============

$ sudo pip install web.py


$ python hello.py
http://0.0.0.0:8080

Visit that URL and you should see "Hello, world!".

You can add an IP address/port after "hello.py" to control where it should
listen for connections (it can be helpful when there is already another service
running on those ports). e.g.:

$ python hello.py 8004
$ python hello2.py 8005


You can also avoid having to type 'python' everytime by doing:

$ chmod +x ./hello.py
$ ./hello.py 1234
