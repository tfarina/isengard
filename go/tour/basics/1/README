Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package main.

This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import
path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the
statement package rand.

Note: the environment in which these programs are executed is deterministic,
so rand.Intn will always return the same number. (To see a different number,
seed the number generator; see rand.Seed.)
