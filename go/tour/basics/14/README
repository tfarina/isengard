Type inference

When declaring a variable without specifying its type (using var without a type
or the := syntax), the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right
hand side.

When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of
that same type:

var i int
j := i // j is an int

But when the right hand side contains an untyped numeric constant, the new
variable may be an int, float64, or complex128 depending on the precision of
the constant:

i := 42           // int
