Named return values

Go's return values may be named and act just like variables.

These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.

A return statement without arguments returns the current values of the results.
This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return statements should be used only in short function, as with the
example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.
