Basic types

Go's basic types are

bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128

The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable
declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.
